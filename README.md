## My process

- Created semantic HTML first
- Created CSS selectors to:
  - create custom variables to contain the various colours used in the design
  - used a CSS reset
  - layout the design using Grid and Flexbox
  - style the various elements, adding in hover states for the buttons
  - added in `:focus` styling for accessibility purposes
  - create a different width layout for mobile version turning the card component into a column

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow (responsive design)
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

Was able to put into practice CSS knowledge of grid, flexbox, custom properties and `:focus`.

### Continued development

Gain extra practice on more complicated layout designs.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Fonts used in the design were [Big Shoulders Design](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Big+Shoulders+Display) using Bold 700 and [Lexend Deca](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca) using regular 400 font styles.
